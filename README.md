# Rainfall
##Problem setting
<p>
The project focuses on analyzing rainfall data and rainfall prediction in Bangladesh,
leveraging historical weather data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. The
project aims to improve long-term rainfall prediction for various divisions and districts,
addressing the impacts of rainfall variability, such as waterlogging in urban areas due to
heavy rain and urban challenges caused by floods or droughts.</p>
##Motivation
<p>Rainfall prediction is critical for sustainable urban planning and management, especially in
a climate-vulnerable nation like Bangladesh. As rapid urbanization and climate change
amplify the unpredictability of weather patterns, accurate and reliable rainfall forecasting
becomes essential for mitigating urban challenges such as flooding, water resource
management, and agricultural planning.</p>
